                <img src="images/AmazonHomepage.jpeg" alt="Amazon Homepage">
                <p>I choose the Amazon Homepage as an example of Alignment because of the way that their selections are horizonataly aligned. This makes it easier to organize the selections and makes it easier for the buyers to find what they want. </p>

                <a class ="link" href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/?lang=eng">Church of Jesus Christ</a>
                <img src="images/Ldspage.jpeg" alt="Church of Jesus Christ Home Page">
                <p>I chose the Church of Jesus Christ Homepage as an example of white space because the designers of this home page understand the importance of allowing the website to increase the emphazis on what is really important. The white space makes it so that the first thing I see is the picture of Jesus Christ at the fountain. It helps emphasize General Conference.</p>

                <img src="images/BYUI Homepage.jpeg" alt="Brigham Young University Idaho Homepage">
                <p>I choose the BYU-Idaho Homepage as an example of Fitts Law because of how easy and accessible the buttons are. All of the buttons are a perfect distance from the pictures and they are not too overwhelming.</p>
